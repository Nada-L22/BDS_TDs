This repository contains solutions to practical exercises on spatial databases using PostgreSQL/PostGIS and QGIS. Each exercise is structured in its own directory with detailed explanations and SQL queries in the respective `README.md` files.

## Repository Structure

- **TD1**: Installation of PostGIS and the creation of a spatial database.
- **TD2**: Creating spatial tables with different geometry types (Points, Polygons, and LineStrings) and manipulating spatial data using QGIS.
- **TD3**: Spatial SQL functions, including buffer zones, centroids, and spatial queries for analyzing parcels within a given radius.
